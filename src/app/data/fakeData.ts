          On a long and lonesome highway
          East of Omaha
          You can listen to the engines moanin'
          Out this one-note song
          You'd think about the woman
          Or the girl you knew the night before
          But your thoughts will soon be wanderin'
          The way they always do
          When you're ridin' 16 hours
          There's nothin' much to do
          And you don't feel much like ridin'
          You just wish the trip was through
          Here I am, on the road again
          There I am, up on the stage
          There I go playin' the star again
          There I go, turn the page
          So you walk into this restaurant
          All strung out from the road
          And you feel the eyes upon you
          As you're shakin' off the cold
          You pretend it doesn't bother you
          But you just want to explode
          Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
          Other times you can
          All the same old clichés
          Is it woman, is it man?
          And you always seem outnumbered
          You don't dare make a stand
          Make your stand
          Here I am, on the road again
          There I am, up on the stage
          Here I go playin' the star again
          There I go, turn the page
          Oh-oh, out there in the spotlight
          You're a million miles away
          Every ounce of energy
          You try and give away
          As the sweat pours out your body
          Like the music that you play, yeah
          Later in the evenin'
          As you lie awake in bed
          With the echoes of the amplifiers
          Ringin' in your head
          You smoke the day's last cigarette
          Rememberin' what she said
          What she said
          Yeah, and here I am, on the road again
          There I am, up on the stage
          Here I go playin' the star again
          There I go, turn the page
          And there I go
          Turn that page
          There I go, yeah, yeah
          There I go, yeah, yeah
          Here I go, yeah
          Here I go, yeah
          There I go
          There I go

      a banda lançou sucessos como "Like a Stone" e "Cochise", mesclando o som experimental do Rage Against the Machine com a profundidade
      emocional de Cornell. O Audioslave encerrou suas atividades em 2007, deixando um legado marcante no rock moderno.

        lyric: `
          And with the early dawn
          Moving right along
          I couldn't buy an eye full of sleep
          And in the aching night, under satellites
          I was not received
          Built with stolen parts
          A telephone in my heart
          Someone get me a priest
          To put my mind to bed
          This ring in my head
          Is this a cure or is this a disease?
          Nail in my hand
          From my creator
          You gave me life
          Now show me how to live
          Nail in my hand
          From my creator
          You gave me life
          Now show me how to live
          And in the after birth
          On the quiet earth
          Let the stains remind you
          You thought you made a man
          You better think again
          Before my role defines you
          Nail in my hand
          From my creator
          You gave me life
          Now show me how to live
          Nail in my hand
          From my creator
          You gave me life
          Now show me how to live
          And in your waiting hands
          I will land
          And roll out of my skin
          And in your finals hours I will stand
          Ready to begin
          Ready to begin
          Ready to begin
          Ready to begin
          Nail in my hand
          From my creator
          You gave me life
          Now show me how to live
          Nail in my hand
          From my creator
          You gave me life
          Now show me how to live
          Show me how to live
          Show me how to live
          Show me how to live
          Show me how to live

          Once upon a time
          I was of the mind to lay your burden down
          And leave you where you stood
          And you believed I could
          You'd seen it done before
          I could read your thoughts
          Tell you what you saw and never say a word
          But now all that is gone
          Overwith and done
          Never to return
          I can tell you why
          People die alone
          I can tell you I'm
          A shadow on the Sun
          Staring at the loss
          Looking for a cause
          And never really sure
          Nothing but a hole
          To live without a soul
          And nothing to be learned
          I can tell you why
          People go insane!
          I can show you how
          You could do the same!
          I can tell you why
          The end will never come!
          I can tell you I'm
          A shadow on the Sun!
          Shapes of every size
          Move behind my eyes
          Doors inside my head
          Bolted from within
          Every drop of flame
          Lights a candle in
          Memory of the one
          Who lives inside my skin
          I can tell you why
          People go insane!
          I can show you how
          You could do the same!
          I can tell you why
          The end will never come!
          I can tell you I'm
          A shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Shadow on the Sun!
          Sun!
          Sun!

          Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
          Someone kills the pain
          Spinning in the silence
          She finally drifts away
          Someone gets excited in a chapel-yard
          And catches a bouquet
          Another lays a dozen
          White roses on a grave
          Yeah
          And to be yourself is all that you can do
          Hey
          To be yourself is all that you can do
          Someone finds salvation in everyone
          Another only pain
          Someone tries to hide himself
          Down inside himself he prays
          Someone swears his true love
          Until the end of time
          Another runs away
          Separate or united, healthy or insane
          And to be yourself is all that you can do
          (All that you can do)
          To be yourself is all that you can do
          (All that you can do)
          To be yourself is all that you can do
          (All that you can do)
          To be yourself is all that you can do
          And even when you've paid enough
          Been pulled apart or been held up
          Every single memory of the good or bad
          Faces of luck
          Don't lose any sleep tonight
          I'm sure everything will end up alright
          You may win or lose
          But to be yourself is all that you can do
          Yeah
          To be yourself is all that you can do
          To be yourself is all that you can do
          (All that you can do)
          To be yourself is all that you can do

          Pearls and swine bereft of me
          Long and weary my road has been
          I was lost in the cities
          Alone in the hills
          No sorrow or pity
          For leaving, I feel

          Don't wait for me
          Cause I'll get on
          All by myself
          I put millions of miles
          Under my heels
          And still

          On a cobweb afternoon
          In a room full of emptiness
          By a freeway, I confess
          I was lost in the pages
          Of a book full of death
          Reading how we'll die alone
          And if we're good, we'll lay to rest
          Anywhere we wanna go
          In your house
          I long to be
          Room by room
          Patiently
          I'll wait for you there
          Like a stone
          I'll wait for you there
          Alone
          And on my deathbed, I will pray
          To the gods and the angels
          Like a pagan, to anyone
          Who will take me to heaven
          To a place I recall
          I was there so long ago
          The sky was bruised, the wine was bled
          And there you led me on
          In your house
          I long to be
          Room by room
          Patiently
          I'll wait for you there

          I'll wait for you there
          Alone
          Alone
          And on I read
          Until the day was gone
          And I sat in regret
          Of all the things I've done
          For all that I've blessed
          And all that I've wronged
          In dreams until my death
          I will wonder on
          In your house
          I long to be
          Room by room
          Patiently
          I'll wait for you there
          Like a stone
          I'll wait for you there

          Alone
